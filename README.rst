*Note: This project is working in progress.*

zdict is a CLI dictionay framework mainly focus on any kind of online dictionary.
This project originly forked from https://github.com/chenpc/ydict, which is a CLI tool for the Yahoo! online dictionary.
After heavily refactoring the original project including:

1. Change from Python 2 to Python 3
2. Focus on being a flexible framework for any kind online dicitionaries, not only just a CLI tool for querying Yahoo! online dictionay.
3. Based on an open source project skeleton.

So, we decided to create a new project.
